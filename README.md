# Claims-Management
An Insurance Company receives many claims from its customers on a daily basis and each of 
these claims need different levels of check. In order to automize this process, the company 
can build a system to determine which level a claim belongs to. The first category contains 
claims for which approval could be accelerated, and the second one contains claims for which 
additional information is required (in other words, they cannot be accelerated).
